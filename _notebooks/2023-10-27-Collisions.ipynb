    "### Plan\n",
    "Collisions is how we will detect interaction between enemies and obstacles with our player. We plan to do this by using axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). It's a mathematical way of detecting collisions between multiple 2d objects. It's typically used for rectangle and square hitboxes, perfect for what we are trying to accomplish. While our sprites aren't rectangular, as you'll know from the hitbox blog, they use rectangles for collision detection."

Now, we compare the x and y values of the player and enemy hitboxes to see if there is any overlap between. If all 4 conditions are meant, then there is an overlap between the two objects. If in fact there is collision between the two sprites, then log Collision in the console. This can be replaced with ore meaningful code, such as deploying a Game Over screen or causing the player to lose health.\n",
